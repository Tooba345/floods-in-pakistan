      <h1>Causes of Floods in Pakistan</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Floods in Pakistan are driven by a mix of powerful natural forces and
        human-made problems. Climate change, extreme monsoon rainfall, glacier
        melt, weak infrastructure and poor planning all combine to create a
        high-risk situation.

        <h3>Heavy monsoon rains</h3>
        <p>
          Pakistan receives most of its rainfall in just a few months
          (July–September). When monsoon systems stall or intensify, some
          regions receive several times their normal rainfall, overwhelming
          rivers and drainage.

        <small>Climate change</small>
        <h3>Warming atmosphere</h3>
        <p>
          A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. This increases the
          likelihood of intense downpours and multi-day rainfall events that
          can trigger "mega-floods" like those in 2010 and 2022.

        <h3>Glacier meltwater</h3>
        <p>
          Pakistan has thousands of glaciers in the Himalaya–Karakoram ranges.
          Rapid melting in warm months, combined with heavy rain, adds large
          volumes of water to the Indus and its tributaries.

        <small>Human factors</small>
        <h3>Poor drainage & planning</h3>
        <p>
          Deforestation, blocked drains, construction in floodplains and weak
          river management reduce the land's ability to absorb and safely
          channel water, turning heavy rain into destructive floods.

        <h3>Heavy Monsoon Rains</h3>
        <p>
          Pakistan receives 70–80% of its annual rainfall during a short
          monsoon season. In 2022, some areas in Sindh and Balochistan saw
          rainfall several hundred percent above normal.

          <li>Warmer sea surface temperatures add moisture to the air.</li>
          <li>Slow-moving storm systems can dump rain over the same area.</li>
          <li>Existing drainage and storage cannot handle such extremes.</li>

        <span class="badge">Climate change</span>
        <h3>Changing Climate</h3>
        <p>
          Rising global temperatures are shifting Pakistan's rainfall patterns
          and increasing the risk of extreme precipitation episodes.
        </p>
        <ul class="custom-list">
          <li>Warmer air holds more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall.</li>
          <li>More frequent and intense heatwaves affect glaciers and soils.</li>
          <li>Monsoon timing and pathways are becoming less predictable.</li>
          <li>Sea-level rise increases coastal flood risk.</li>

      <article class="card">
        <span class="badge">Environment</span>
        <h3>Poor Drainage & Deforestation</h3>
        <p>
          Natural forests and wetlands act like sponges, slowing down water.
          When they are removed and replaced with concrete or bare soil,
          floods worsen.
        </p>
        <ul class="custom-list">
          <li>Deforestation reduces the soil's ability to absorb rainfall.</li>
          <li>Blocked drains and nullahs prevent water from flowing away.</li>
          <li>Informal settlements often lack proper storm-water drainage.</li>

        <h3>Melting Glaciers in the North</h3>
        <p>
          Pakistan hosts one of the largest collections of glaciers outside
          the polar regions. Rising temperatures accelerate melt and increase
          the risk of glacier-lake outburst floods (GLOFs).
        </p>
        <ul class="custom-list">
          <li>Increased summer runoff adds to river discharge.</li>
          <li>New glacial lakes form behind unstable natural dams.</li>
          <li>Sudden GLOF events can send walls of water downstream.</li>
          <li>Long-term glacier loss also threatens future water security.</li>

        <span class="badge">Urbanisation</span>
        <h3>Human Causes & Poor Urban Planning</h3>
        <p>
          Rapid urban growth, often unplanned, puts homes, businesses and
          infrastructure directly in harm's way.
        </p>
        <ul class="custom-list">
          <li>Construction in natural floodplains and along riverbanks.</li>
          <li>Buildings and walls blocking natural drainage routes.</li>
          <li>Solid waste clogging drains and culverts.</li>

        <h3>Indus River System Management</h3>
        <p>
          The Indus and its tributaries are vital for irrigation but can also
          become dangerous when under-managed during extreme flows.
        </p>
        <ul class="custom-list">
          <li>Limited flood storage capacity in reservoirs and barrages.</li>
          <li>Sediment reduces river and canal capacity over time.</li>

        When multiple risk factors overlap, floods turn catastrophic.

      <article class="card">
        <h3>From climate to catastrophe</h3>
        <p>
          Climate change raises background temperatures, which supercharges
          the monsoon. At the same time, glaciers melt faster, adding more
          water to rivers during the rainy season.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Infrastructure under pressure</h3>
        <p>
          When huge volumes of water meet under-designed or poorly maintained
          drains, canals and embankments, the result is overflow, breaches
          and flash floods in both rural and urban areas.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>People in harm's way</h3>
        <p>
          Settlements and farms on floodplains, informal housing along
          nullahs, and lack of early warning systems all increase the number
          of people exposed when a major flood hits.
        </p>
      </article>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-info">
      <strong>Takeaway:</strong> Reducing flood risk requires tackling all
      these causes together – from global climate action to local drainage,
      land-use planning and community preparedness.
