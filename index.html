      <h1>Floods in Pakistan: From Disaster to Resilience</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Pakistan faces recurring and increasingly intense floods, driven by heavy monsoon rains,
        melting glaciers and climate change. The 2022 "mega-floods" affected tens of millions
        of people and became a global symbol of climate vulnerability.

        <small>Context</small>
        <h3>Geography & major rivers</h3>
        <p>
          Pakistan is crossed by the Indus River and its tributaries, flowing from the Himalayas
          and Karakoram ranges down to the Arabian Sea. Many cities, villages and farms are
          located on floodplains where seasonal river swelling is common.

      <article class="card">
        <small>Climate</small>
        <h3>Monsoon & glacier melt</h3>
        <p>
          Most of the country's rainfall arrives during the summer monsoon. Intense rainstorms,
          combined with accelerated glacier melt in the north, can quickly raise river levels
          and trigger riverine and flash floods.
        </p>

      <article class="card">
        <small>Risk</small>
        <h3>Why risk is increasing</h3>
        <p>
          Rapid urbanisation, settlements close to riverbeds, deforestation, poor drainage
          systems and climate change all increase flood frequency and severity, especially in
          Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

      <strong>Key message:</strong> Floods in Pakistan are not only "natural disasters".
      Human decisions about land use, infrastructure, planning and emissions make communities
      much more or less vulnerable.
