        <h3>National Disaster Management plans</h3>
        <p>
          Pakistan has developed national disaster management plans and policies that
          set out roles and responsibilities for federal, provincial and district
          authorities in preparing for and responding to floods and other hazards.

        <h3>National Flood & Monsoon Contingency plans</h3>
        <p>
          Each year, the NDMA coordinates a National Monsoon Contingency Plan with
          provinces, focusing on forecasted rainfall, vulnerable districts, resource
          needs and standard operating procedures for evacuation and relief.

        <h3>Urban flood management guidelines</h3>
        <p>
          Updated technical guidelines and studies on urban flooding provide
          recommendations on drainage, land use, early warning, and coordination
          between municipal and disaster management authorities.

        <h3>Strengthening early warning systems</h3>
        <p>
          The government is expanding weather and river-gauge networks and improving
          real-time data sharing between the Meteorological Department, NDMA, PDMAs
          and local administrations to issue more accurate and timely warnings.

        <h3>Inclusive disaster risk management</h3>
        <p>
          Recent initiatives emphasise inclusive early warning systems, community
          engagement and guidelines that address the needs of women, children and
          persons with disabilities during evacuations and relief.
