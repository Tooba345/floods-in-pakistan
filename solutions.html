      <h1>How to avoid floods in Pakistan</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        No single measure can "stop" floods in Pakistan, but a combination of
        structural, nature-based and social solutions can significantly reduce
        disaster losses and protect vulnerable communities.

        <h3>Stronger embankments & drainage</h3>
        <p>
          Upgrading river embankments, spurs, barrages and urban drainage systems
          can reduce the frequency of damaging floods. Design must take into account
          future climate-driven extremes, not just past records.

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Retention basins & floodplains</h3>
        <p>
          Allowing certain zones to temporarily store floodwater – through retention
          basins, wetlands and protected floodplains – can lower peak flows and reduce
          pressure on embankments and cities downstream.

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Ecosystem restoration</h3>
        <p>
          Reforestation in catchment areas, mangrove restoration along the coast and
          protection of wetlands can slow runoff, stabilise riverbanks and provide
          natural buffers against flooding.

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Climate-resilient housing</h3>
        <p>
          Using raised plinths, flood-resistant materials, improved foundations and
          safe site selection for housing reduces the chance that families will lose
          everything in the next flood.

        <h3>Early warning systems</h3>
        <p>
          Modern weather forecasts, river gauge networks, flood modelling and mobile-phone
          alerts give communities more time to evacuate, protect livestock and secure
          essential documents.

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Community-based disaster risk reduction</h3>
        <p>
          Training local disaster committees, organising evacuation drills, mapping
          safe routes and shelters, and involving women and youth in planning all
          improve local response capacity.

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Land-use planning & building codes</h3>
        <p>
          Enforcing zoning regulations that restrict construction in high-risk areas,
          and applying resilient building codes, can prevent new risk from being built
          into cities and villages.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Social protection & insurance</h3>
        <p>
          Cash transfer programmes, crop and livestock insurance, and emergency
          social protection schemes help families absorb shocks and recover faster
          without falling into long-term poverty.

    <div class="callout callout-success">
      <strong>Good practice:</strong> Many successful pilots in Pakistan combine early
      warning, evacuation planning, resilient housing and livelihood support at the
      village level. Scaling these efforts is a key challenge.
